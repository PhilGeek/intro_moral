# Introduction to Moral Philosophy #

The files in this directory are an evolving set of notes for a course of introductory lectures on ethics. Work began on them in 2005. The goal is to provide an introduction to ethical thought through the careful examination of historical figures. Eventually, four key figures will be covered:

1. Hume
2. Kant
3. Mill
4. Nietzsche

So far (as of 2007-06-20) there are notes on Hume and Kant though these need revision. The plan is to add the Nietzsche component, and then the Mill component, and then some concluding remarks drawing out persistent themes through the works of these diverse thinkers.

There is a directory for each of these thinkers and subdirectories containing the text of each lecture and beamer presentation, and notes pertinent to these.

Here is the directory structure:
