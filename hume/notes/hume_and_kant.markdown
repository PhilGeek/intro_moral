# On the role of human nature #

## Hume

Much of the *Treatise* is structured around a contrast between two kinds of inquiry. Metaphysical inquire investigates the supersensible natures of things---such as the necessary connection between cause and effect or a self that underlies human perceptions, whereas Hume's moral science investigates human nature on the basis of its sensible effects. Given the cautious observation of humans and human activity, the moral scientist seeks to explain these diverse phenomena in terms of a few general principles. Hume ultimately despairs of the metaphysical speculation about the supersensible nature of things. Hume doesn't deny that things have supersensible natures, he claims only that there is no point in speculating about this since we lack the means to know these things. The prospects for Hume's new science of human nature are more bright. Hume believes for example that his theory of the passions displays many of the virtues that Newton's theory of matter displays. Each displays a theoretical economy--each is an empirical inquiry that explains diverse phenomena in terms of a few general principles

Hume's new science of human nature, like Newton's theory, is primarily *descriptive* and *explanatory*, as opposed ot *prescriptive* and *justificatory*. Moral science seeks to describe diverse phenomena of human psychology and activity and explain these in terms of a few general principles. Moral science does not seek to *prescribe* that we make certain moral judgments. Hume is not recommending moral judgements to his audience---he takes it for granted that there is a large measure of agreement at least about fudnamental matters of morals between himself and his audience. So Hume is not engaged in any casuistry, nor is he offering a moral sermon or panygeric to Virtue.  Nor does moral science seek to *justify* the moral judgements that we actually do make. Hume is not trying to justify the moral judgments we make. He is not trying to persuade a moral skeptic. Again he takes it for granted that there is a large measure of moral agreement between himself and his audience. Hume is explicit about this contrast when he describes as an anotmist of morals and contrasts this witht he Painter of Virtue. Hume worries that: "Any warm Sentiment of Morals, I am afraid, would have the Air of Declamation amidst abstract Reasonings, & wou’d be esteem’d contrary to good Taste."

Not only is Hume's moral science descriptive and explanatory, but the explanations it seeks are *naturalistic*. Hume seeks to give an account of human morality as a natural phenomena---as arising from human nature and our place in nature. He thus rejects any attempt to give a theological foundation to morality of a kind that natural law theorists recommended. Not only does the science of human nature offer naturalistic explanations for the moral distinctions that we make but the naturalistic explanations that Hume ultimately offers takes a particular form: Hume offers a sentimentalist explanation of the moral distinctions we make. According to *sentimentalism* moral distinctions are determined not by reason but by moral sense.

## Kant

Kant might seem to have the opposite view:

> Everyone must admit that a law , if it is to hold morally, i.e., as a ground of obligation, must imply absolute necessity; he must admit that the command "Thou shalt not lie" does not apply to men only, as if other rational beings had no need to observe it. The same is true for all other moral laws properly so called. he must concede that the ground of obligation here must be sought in the nature of man or in the circumstances in which he is placed, but sought *a prior* solely in the concepts of pure reason. (G 4:389)

But this is misleading.

> The field of philosophy in the cosmopolitan sense can be brought down to the following questions: 
>
> 1. 	What can I know?
> 2. 	What ought I to do?
> 3. 	What may I hope?
> 4. 	What is the human being?
>
> Metaphysics answers the first question, morals the second, religion the third, and anthropology the fourth. Fundamentally, however, we could reckon all of this to anthropology, because the first three questions refer to the last one” (Ak 9:25).

## On reasons and sentiment

### Hume on reason and sentiment

Potential revisionary implications of Hume's view---seems at odds with the moral phenomenology of the vulgar.

Calm vs violent passions

### Kant on reason and sentiment

The philanthropist

Scruples of Conscience

I like to serve my friends, but unfortunately I do it by inclination
And so I am bothered by the thought that I am not virtuous.

Decision

There is no other way but this! You must seek to despise them
And do with repugnance what duty bids you.

Kant, however, explicitly denies these commitments. Kant does not believe that we should strive to eliminate all nonmoral incentives to do our duty. Rather, Kant explicitly claims that we have a duty to cultivate love, sympathy, and other inclinations that make it easier to do our duty (MS 6:456–7). Moreover, Kant denies that actions done from duty are done “with repugnance”. Conforming to duty with repugnance reveals “a hidden hatred of the law” and is the opposite of acting with a good will (R 6:24n). The line of thought leading to Schiller’s satire goes wrong at the very first step. It is not the case that a good will only ever acts from duty. A person can possess a good will even in circumstances where no duty applies to his action. Moreover, a divine will is a good will even though it is impossible for it to act from duty (since being infinite in nature it is not subject to the “subjective limitations and hindrances” of finite beings).

### Hume vs Kant

Kant might claim that Hume is deficient in only admitting empirical desires.

Not clear. Hume seems to think that sentiments recommend their objects.


## On Categorical Imperatives

### Hume

In a civilized state, if not in a rude and natural state, a sense of duty can move a person to observe the demands of justice even it is not beneficial to himself or otehrs and even if it is harmful to himself and otehrs. The demands of duty seem to be quite independent of human inclination, that is, the contingent configuration of the huamn passions. The categorical demands of our sense of duty seem inconsistent with a sentimentalist acccount of them.

Hume's strategy is again reconciliationist, he wants to allow that there is something that is registered by the moral experience of the vulgar and yet that they tend to misconceive this.

The key difference between the natural and artific ial virtues is this: While the operation of the natural virtues invariably results in some good, the operation fo the artificial virtues does not. Justice, for example, can demand a repayment of debt even if it is contrary to private and public utility. Public utility does not attache to particular observances of the rules of justice but to the general scheme or convention. These conventions are first established by man's self interest and confined beneveolence in conditions of scarcity where the relevant goods admit of easy exchange. Once set up, and society stabilizes and grows, the original motive to justice has a tendency to wane and the temptation to free ride increases. However, there arises a new motive to justice as we come to attach a kind of moral beauty to the observances of the rules of justice just because they are what justice requries. This pleasure we register in the observances of justice due to the oepration fo sympathy and the imagination is independent of whether the particular observance serves any antecedent end we may have.

What's registered by the moral experience of the vulgar is the contrast between the natural and artificial virtues, that artifical virtues is independent of private and public utility and may even be contrary to private and public utility. Neverhteless Hume can explain why this is so by postulating the principle of sympathy at work in generating our moral sentiments.

Here, I must confess, that at leas in one respect, Hume's recocniliationist ambtions are frustrated. The domain of duty, the domain of the categorical, is conceived by Hume to be far more restrictive than the vulgar conceive it to be. According to Hume, the only duties to which we owe categorical allegiance are duties of property, allegiance to the state, promise-keeping, and chastity. This is are more restricted conception of duty than the one that the vulgar operate with. To take one prime example, Hume allows for no duties oa aid. So Hume can capture the phenomeology of the conflict of duty and inclination but at the cost of restricting the range of dutes there are, perhaps unduly so.

### Kant vs Hume

> Empirical principles are not at all suited to serve as the basis of moral laws. For if the basis of the universality by which they should be valid for all rational beings without distinction ... is derived from a particular tendency of human nature or the accidental circumstances in which it is found, then the universality is lost (G 4:442)

Two points:

*	Epistemological: The moral law is empirical or something known a posteriori. Hume agrees.
*	Constituency: The moral law applies to all rational beings and not to men only.

Kant elaborates:

>Everyone must admit that a law , if it is to hold morally, i.e., as a ground of obligation, must imply absolute necessity; he must admit that the command "Thou shalt not lie" does not apply to men only, as if other rational beings had no need to observe it. The same is true for all other moral laws properly so called. he must concede that the ground of obligation here must be sought in the nature of man or in the circumstances in which he is placed, but sought *a prior* solely in the concepts of pure reason. (G 4:389)

Hume writes in a letter to Francis Hutcheson:

>I wish from my heart I could avoid concluding that, since morality according to your opinion as well as mine is determined merely by sentiments, it regards only human nature and human life. (16 March 1740)

Hume was perhaps overly worried. We need only distinguish the determinant of the standard and the content of the standard. This is masked by an ambiguity in ``determine'', ``regards'', and ``derived'':

*	explanatory
*	justificatory

Read in the justificatory sense, human nature and sentiment must be reflected in the content of the standard.

## Self-Knowledge and Moral Transformation

### Hume

The knowledge that a Humean moral scientist seeks is a kind of self-knowledge. The moral scientist seeks to explain the distinctions we make between vice and virtue in terms of our common human nature extended, where it is, by human convention. In learning about the few general principles that govern the diverse phenomena of human sentiment and that determine our judgments of vice and virtue, we learn about ourselves. We learn what kind of creatures we are.

While reason alone can neither determine the will nor oppose the passions determination of the will, the self-knowledge we gain from Hume's moral science is not entirely indifferent to us. We come to naturally approve of our moral judgements and the principles that give rise to them. The human affective sensibility must be so configured, that the kind of self-knowledge that afforded us by Hume's science of human nature is naturally pleasing to us upon the general view or survey. Not only is this self-knowledge pleasing to the human sensibility, it helps to transform our moral character. In particular, this self-knowledge strngthens our virtuous character:

>But this sense [sense of morals] must certainly acquire new force, when reflecting on itself, it approves of those principles, from whence it is deriv'd, and finds nothing but what is great and good in its rise and origin. 

So in approving of the the principles that determines our moral sense, the moral sense aquires new force, it gains new strength. Strength is a matter of causal control. Thus the causal influence of our sense of moral would tend to increase once it reflects on and approves of the principles upon which it is founded. In the case of the aritificial virtues, such as justice, this would be manifest in an increased ability of the sense of duty, the sense of the moral beauty of particular observances of the conventions of justice, to oppose other passions that might conflict with it, such as selfishness or even benevolence. The categorical nature of these demands would be strengthened.

Though Hume sets out to be an anatomist of morals rather than a painter of virtue, nevertheless, the kind of self-knoweldge we gain from teh science of human nature has a natural tendency to transform our moral character by strnegthening the operation of our moral sense. In gaining this self-knowledge, our moral character is transformed. Like Socrates before him, Hume sees a connection between self-knowledge and human virtue.

The precise connection he sees is perhaps the finest expression of Humean optimism. Humean optimism is characterized by a realsitic if cheerful appraisal of human nature. We are not uitterly selfish, but neitehr are we angels. Even given this realistic and balanced conception of human motivation, Hume is pleased with what it gives rise to, the moral distinctions it makes and the principles that govern these.

### Kant

We all more or less know right from wrong even if we are tempted to make exceptions for ourselves. Specifically, we are equipped with common rational moral cognition---pre-reflective, practical knowledge of the moral law. Nevertheless, philosophical inquiry is required to gain reflective, theoretical knowledge of the moral law. Just as wisdom has need of science not to learn from it but to gain durability and access to its principles, common rational moral cognition has need of philosophy not to learn from it but to gain durability and access to its principles. Thus common rational moral cognition can recognize a practical motive to engage in the philosophical reflection that Kant pursues in the second section of the *Groundwork*. There, Kant argues that whereas the first formula is best for the appraisal of action, for access to the moral law the three formulas should be applied to one and the same action thereby bringing the moral law closer to intuition and thereby feeling.

While it is not yet clear what Kant means by `access to the moral law', Kant is at least claiming this much: With the first formula as an external aid, a person has sufficient means to act in conformity with duty. But by gaining access to the moral law thereby bringing it closer to intuition and thereby feeling, a person forms a strong desire to act from duty even though there is no positive inclination to do so or a strong inclination to act contrary to duty. In forming such a desire, common rational moral cognition ensures the durability of its principle.

The durability of a principle is a matter of the degree and stability of its causal influence. The increased durability of the moral law in a person's conduct is explained as follows: In intuiting the dignity of humanity, the value of objects of inclination pale in comparison if indeed they are experienced to be of value at all. The intuition of human dignity gives rise to a distinctive moral pleasure, the feeling of respect. Together they constitute the pure desire to act from duty since a desire just is the representation of an object accompanied by a feeling of pleasure. What's represented in intuition is the grounds of the reasons for acting from duty, and the feeling of respect is a conscious manifestation of the value of the intuited dignity. It is not possible to respect the dignity of humanity and to take pleasure in the fulfillment of an inclination contrary to duty---the feeling of respect precludes such pleasures. This is a way in which the incomparable value of dignity is consciously manifest to the person who intuits it. From this perspective, the perspective of a virtuous sensibility, inclinations contrary to duty do not seem to be reasons and so are motivationally inefficacious. Moreover, since the pure desire does not depend on inclination for its object, it can operate even in the absence of positive inclination. The pure desire to act from duty thus plays an important explanatory role in the motivational psychology of a virtuous sensibility, even though it is a response to reasons and not their source.

The knowledge common rational moral cognition gains through philosophical reflection is a kind of self-knowledge. It is not knowledge of right and wrong, that we more or less already have, but knowledge of what we desire as free and rational beings. This is a manifestation of Kant's Pietist background. Kant is looking for a reasonable form of moral reflection to check the purity of our motives. This form of moral reflection is practically necessary since, without it, we are easily tempted to act from wrong reasons.

In acting from duty, a virtuous person does so out of a phenomenologically vivid sense of the value that grounds the reasons for so acting. It is this phenomenologically vivid sense of the value of humanity that Kant experiences in reading Rousseau (and that presumably `tears' the philanthropist from his `deadly insensibility' G 4:398). Kant has not altogether abandoned the moral sentimentalism of his youth. Indeed, his remarks about the practical interest in the moral law can be understood as a (partial) interpretation of Butler's  characterization of moral sense: Insofar as the intuition of a virtuous sensibility takes as its object the value that grounds our duty it is a `perception of the heart'; insofar as the feeling of respect is part of the noncognitive response to the reasons grounded in this value---insofar as it is `self-wrought from reason' (G 4:401n)---it is a `sentiment of the understanding'.
